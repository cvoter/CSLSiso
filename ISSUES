# ISSUES for isoH2Obudget

Current issues:  
 * Colnames in raw isotope spreadsheet apparently have extra spaces (d18O..VSMOW.)
 * Need to add ways to validate raw data to make sure I'm subsetting correctly and not losing data due to unexpected data formatting, ESPECIALLY for isotope data.
 * Need lubridate on personal laptop
 * Add README to repo
