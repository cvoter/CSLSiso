# ISSUES for isoH2Obudget

Current issues:  
 * Need reference (and in some cases, units) for alpha_factor, normalized_humidity, sat_vapor_press. Check with Katie/Meg.
 * Need to add ways to validate raw data to make sure I'm subsetting correctly and not losing data due to unexpected data formatting, ESPECIALLY for isotope data.
 * Add README to repo
 * Add scripts to visualize isotope and water level data and decide on upstream vs. downstream wells
 
Previous issues:  
 * Colnames in raw isotope spreadsheet apparently have extra spaces (d18O..VSMOW.)
   - Format in Excel spreadsheet is "d18O (VSMOW)". Keep as is in spreadsheet and in R functions.
