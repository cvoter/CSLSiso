# ISSUES for isoH2Obudget

Current issues:  
 * Need to add data validation to functions.
 * Add README to repo
 * Interpolate missing hancock weather station values for temp, relative humidity, and reference PET
 * Update assignment of precip measurements to months
 * Sensitivity analysis of lake isotope measurements: monthly vs. one value entire year vs. two values per year (summer/spring)
 * Use bathymetry vol vs. stage to get dV/dt. Check that vathymetry relationships are corrected to be relative to mean sea level
 * Sensitivity analysis of using well levels at each measurement to classify upgradient vs. downgradient vs. static assignment.
 * What if don't assume lake is well mixed and del_L = del_GWout?
 
Previous issues:  
 * Colnames in raw isotope spreadsheet apparently have extra spaces (d18O..VSMOW.)
   - Format in Excel spreadsheet is "d18O (VSMOW)". Keep as is in spreadsheet and in R functions.   
 * Need reference (and in some cases, units) for alpha_factor, normalized_humidity, sat_vapor_press. Check with Katie/Meg.
 * Add scripts to visualize isotope and water level data and decide on upstream vs. downstream wells
