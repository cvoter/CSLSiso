## Overview

This illustrates the differences between using **FAO Penman-Monteith Reference
ET**, which is what Hancock Station includes in their weather data, vs.
calculating **lake evaporation** for an open body of water. I don't think FAO
Penman-Montheith Reference ET is appropriate for a lake because it represents ET
from a cropped surface. An open body of water has a very difference
resistance to ET than a leaf.

The method I use to calculate lake evaporation is based on McJannet et al.
(2008), as presented in the overview of methods for estimating
evaporation by McMahon et al. (2013). McMahon et al. (2013) suggests that this
method is appropriate for a range of water bodies (irrigation channel, shallow
and deep lakes) and they provide a worked example which I used to validate my
code. There are 1-2 other approaches listed as appropriate for a "shallow" lake
which I could check, but it would take more time to code that up and it's less
clear to me that they work for the range of lake sizes in the CSLS.

There are three ways that the current code could be improved for the CSLS
lakes:

* Use a dynamic time series of water depth and lake surface area. For time
reasons, I simply threw in a static surface area and depth for each lake.
* Use a dynamic time series of daily lake surface temperature. I'm currently
initiating a daily time series of lake surface temperature with the first
field-based measurement, then letting the estimation approach take it away from
there.
* Use a daily lake temperature profile to calculate heat flux out of the lake.

## Lake Comparisons

When the FAO Penman-Monteith method is compared to the lake evaporation method,
it's clear that this does make a big difference. At a gut check level, the **new
timeseries of lake ET makes more sense** to me. Each lake has a slightly
different evaporation rate, driven by the size of the water body. Pleasant Lake,
the deepest lake, can retain more heat so variations in ET are more muted and
slightly shifted toward the fall when compared with ET patterns at Long Lake and
Plainfield Lake. Lake ET rates tend to be higher than FAO reference ET rates
throughout the entire year (except maybe February, and except Pleasant in early
spring), which also makes sense since resistance to evaporation from a water
body is much lower than resistance to evaporation from a leaf, provided the lake
is sufficiently warm.
